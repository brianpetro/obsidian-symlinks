Hey there! I'm [Your Name], the developer behind the Symlink Manager Plugin. I believe in creating tools that simplify workflows and enhance productivity. Follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/wfhbrian) for updates and sneak peeks!

## A Brief Introduction

Managing symlinks across different operating systems can be a challenge, especially when syncing your Obsidian vault between devices. The Symlink Manager Plugin is designed to simplify this process, ensuring your symlinks are always up-to-date and functional, no matter which platform you're on.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide a seamless experience for Obsidian users who need to manage symlinks across multiple platforms. By automating the recreation of symlinks and providing an intuitive interface, we aim to enhance your productivity and reduce the technical hassle.

## Discover the Symlink Manager Plugin

The Symlink Manager Plugin automates the process of creating and managing symlinks within your Obsidian vault, as well as linking to external files and directories. Here's what makes it stand out:

### Key Features

- **Platform-Specific Symlink Recreation**: Automatically detects your operating system and recreates symlinks accordingly.
- **External Symlink Support**: Create symlinks to files and folders outside your vault.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily add or remove symlinks with intuitive modals.
- **Persistent Configurations**: Stores platform-specific target paths and prompts for updates when needed.

## How It Works

### Managing Symlinks

- **Creating Symlinks**: Use the command palette to add a new symlink. Select the destination folder within your vault, specify the symlink name, and enter the target path.
- **Platform Detection**: The plugin automatically detects your operating system and manages symlinks accordingly.
- **Recreation on Startup**: Symlinks are recreated each time you start Obsidian on a different platform.
- **Handling Missing Targets**: If a target path isn't available on the current platform, you'll be prompted to provide a new one.

### Technical Details

- **Symlink Configurations**: Stored in a persistent data file within the plugin's directory, maintaining platform-specific paths.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear notifications if symlink creation fails due to permission issues or invalid paths.
- **Compatibility**: Works with Windows (`win32`), macOS (`darwin`), and Linux platforms.
